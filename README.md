# Overview

I wanted to learn C++ so I made a small hangman game. It was my first time doing a Hangman Game so I did start by finding [this](http://www.cppforschool.com/project/hangman-game-code.html) tutorial to help me get started on the basic game logic.
However, I added in the capability to pull words from a file instead of an in code array, I made it so it didn't punish you for guessing the same letter twice, I used a class to keep track of the number of lives the player had as well as made a function that would draw the hangman.'

Because I was able to read in the txt file and get the drawings working I don't really have anything else I would want to add.
